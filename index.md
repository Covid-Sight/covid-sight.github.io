## Overview
Welcome to Covidsight! The goal of this project is to create an application that will be used as a "warm up" for two HACC events that our group will be participating in. This application is to be build as a requirement for ICS 496 as the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This application is to act as a COVID-19 tracking application, similar to the University of Hawaii's COVID-19 tracking application _**[Lumisight](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/covid-19-resources/about-lumisight-uh/)**_.

## Goals
As stated above, our goal is to create a COVID-19 tracking application that mimics the functionality of _**Lumisight**_. This application will allow logged in users to log if they are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or not. This will be done by having the user answer a quick survey asking if they have any of the COVID-19 symptoms listed. The user will then have the ability to click "yes" or "no". Upon submission of the user answer, the user answer will be stored and displayed on another page of the application with the data of the submission, acting as a record for the user. This status can be changed at any part of the day if the user chooses to resubmit their answer. The application will also allow the user to upload information about their vaccination status by having them upload an image of their vaccine card if necessary.
